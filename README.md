# Part1. Data Visualization:
In the initial phase of our NLP Persian text preprocessing project, we will begin by exploring the dataset's characteristics and gaining insights into the textual data. Through data visualization techniques, we will generate informative plots and statistics to better understand the distribution of text, the frequency of words, and any patterns that may emerge from the Persian text data.

# Part2. Using Hazm Library:
For effective Persian text preprocessing, we will leverage the powerful Hazm library, specifically designed for the Persian language. Hazm offers a comprehensive suite of tools for text normalization, tokenization, stemming, and more. We will delve into the usage of Hazm's features to ensure our text data is transformed into a format suitable for further analysis.

# Part3. Clustering:
To uncover underlying patterns and group related pieces of text, we will employ clustering techniques. By applying clustering algorithms to our preprocessed Persian text data, we aim to discover similarities and differences among documents or sentences. This step will help us identify topics, themes, or categories within the text data.

# Part4. Word Cloud Visualization:
Finally, as a visual representation of the most frequent words and their importance in the Persian text corpus, we will generate word clouds. These word clouds will provide an intuitive and concise view of key terms, enabling us to identify prominent themes and trends in the dataset. This visualization will serve as a valuable summary of our NLP preprocessing efforts.
